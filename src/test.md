# Hey, I'm Eesa 

Welcome to **SlateGen**, my handcrafted static site generator built with pure C++ — no frameworks, no bloat, just raw speed and simplicity.

---

SlateGen takes your plain Markdown files and turns them into sleek, responsive HTML pages — basically, it makes your text look like it has a life now.

It’s built for:
- Developers who love *minimal tools that just work*
- People who hate dealing with bloated site builders
- Students who want to flex their projects with style

---

##  Features

- Converts `.md` → `.html` lightning fast  
- Automatically styles your site with a clean, modern CSS layout  
- Handles headers, lists, links, code, and inline formatting  
- Can also go **reverse**: `.html` → `.md` (because balance matters)

##  Example Markdown Tricks

### Headings

# Big Header
## Medium Header

Closing Note

SlateGen isn’t trying to compete with the giants.
It’s just one of those projects that feels good to build and even better to show off.
